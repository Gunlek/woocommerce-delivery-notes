A WordPress plugin to print invoices and delivery notes for WooCommerce.  

== Description ==

With this plugin you can print out simple invoices and delivery notes for the WooCommerce orders. You can edit the Company/Shop name, Company/Shop postal address and also add personal notes, conditions/policies (like a refund policy) and a footer imprint.

The plugin adds a new side panel on the order page to allow shop administrators to print out the invoice or delivery notes. This is useful for a lot of shops that sell goods which need delivery notes for shipping or with added refund policies etc. In some countries (e.g. in the European Union) such refund policies are required so this plugin could help to combine this with the order info for the customer.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `woocommerce-delivery-notes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Choose `WooCommerce` then `Settings` and the tab `Print` to adjust the settings to your need.
4. Print the order with the side panel on the actual order page.
