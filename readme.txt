Print order invoices & delivery notes for the WooCommerce shop plugin.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can print out simple invoices and delivery notes for the orders via the WooCommerce Shop Plugin. You can edit the Company/Shop name, Company/Shop postal address and also add personal notes, conditions/policies (like a refund policy) and a footer imprint/branding.

The plugin adds a new side panel on the order page to allow shop administrators to print out delivery notes. This is useful for a lot of shops that sell goods which need delivery notes for shipping or with added refund policies etc. In some countries (e.g. in the European Union) such refund policies are required so this plugin could help to combine this with the order info for the customer.

= Features =
* The plugin comes with an attached template for the invoice and delivery note (printing) page - you could also copy this to your theme and customize it to your needs! The plugin will recognize the new place. (See under [FAQ here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce-print-order/faq/))
* All setting fields on the plugin's settings pages are optional - you can leave them empty to not use them at all or only apply what you need.
* If there are added "Customer Notes" (regular WooCommerce feature) for an order these will automatically displayed at the bottom of the delivery note.
* Custom order numbering via the free [WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce-sequential-order-numbers/) plugin.
